# Learning Languages

## Java
Java is a great first language to learn because of its verbose nature and its ability to be decompiled after being built. It is an object oriented programming language, which means that you don't need to touch code that you know is working in the likely case of bugs.

#### Headfirst Java
This book was a refreshing change of pace compared to the many other Java books I had attempted to comprehend. It uses comedy and real-world examples to lessen the amount of compsci jargon and the usual esotericism in this genre of books which helped me to fully digest the content I was reading.
I have provided two links to free pdfs in case one of them fails:
 - https://github.com/indrabasak/Books/raw/master/Head%20First%20Java%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf
 - https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4951/Head_First_Java_Second_Edition.pdf

#### Kody Simpson
His youtube channel helped me to reconcile two hobbies I liked but had previously thought mutually exclusive: Minecraft and programming.
Using the Spigot/Bukkit API, his tutorials on plugin development allowed to to quickly and accurately test code I had written in Minecraft, which I think is quite gratifying. Admittedly, I didn't watch his Java tutorials but if they are anything like his Spigot ones they should be very helpful.

#### Fabric Docs
Fabric is another, though quite a bit more advanced, Minecraft loader. The documentation of Fabric was really great when I made the switch, because Fabric allows you to directly change the game's code, instead of overriding it like Spigot does.

## Rust
Rust is my favourite language by far. It is one of the fastest languages out there, and with epsilon overhead, it is perfect for running in production. I have used to write several backends for websites, automated Discord bots and even programs that allow me to buy products the second they are restocked. However, Rust has a steep learning curve and is considered a hybrid language, blending in object oriented, functional and procedural programming. Another factor to consider is its lack of readability. You will have to become very comfortable in Rust to be able to type quicker than 40wpm.

#### The Book
Affectionately nicknamed "The Book", the Rust documentation and tutorials helped me considerably to start out. It provides some great examples, and even teaches you how to recreate retro games using Rust.

#### Serenity
Serenity is a useful Rust wrapper for the Discord API, which allows you to create your own Discord bot using rust. Because of how little resources Rust actually uses to run, you could easily set this up on a raspberry pi or even home desktop.

#### Bevy
Bevy is a game engine that was written in Rust, uses Rust, and compiles to Rust, so it is a great way to learn quickly. There are many resources out there concerning Bevy, but for the sake of clarity I'll only list a few:
 - [Their GitHub page](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
 - [Their documentation](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/)
 - [A youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb3vInxzKGE)

# Learning Ethical Hacking

### HackTheBox
HTB is the website I began learning how to hack ethically with. It has many scripted challenges, and an Alexandrian archive created by the community. However, some features of HTB are paid, and is quite expensive comparatively.
 - [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)
 - [HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/)

### HackThisSite
HTS is a community-maintained website used to provide people with a way to legally test their hacking skills, learn how to hack and talk to other likeminded people on their forums. 
 - https://hackthissite.org/

### VulnHub
VulnHub is a penetration-based resource used to test injection and bruteforce attempts. It allows its users to create their own tests and programs.

# Tools

### Github
GitHub is an all-in-one coding experience. It is a remote archive for you to upload all of your code to, test deployment, build to multiple OS and architectures, report bugs and collaborate with others. It also offers an amazing Student Developer Pack, which is equal to the value of $200,000. It provides a professional subscription to many of the other tools shown.

### JetBrains Suite
The JetBrains Suite is the equivalent of the Adobe suite in the programming world. All apps in the suite have a beautiful UI and are all filled to the brim with functionality. Much like the Adobe suite, it is a paid subscription, however the GitHub Student Developer Pack waives these fees for the duration of your study. IntelliJ is the leading IDE in the Java developer environment, and therefore offers a completely free version for when your subscription ends, at the cost of a few of the extra functionality in the Pro edition.

### VSCode
Visual Studio Code is Microsoft's very own minimal IDE. Coupled with the million or so extensions on the VSCode marketplace, you can code with any language you choose.

### Termius
Termius is an all-in-one remote connection client. With SFTP, SSH, keygen, port-forwarding and macro capabilities Termius is perfect for sysadmin jobs. It has a free and paid version, with the paid version being waived again through the GitHub Student Developer Pack.

### Git
Git is a file system manager made for developers. It is the basis upon which GitHub was built. It's a little different from the other tools, with it needed to be installed through the command line, or CLI. Installation instructions can be found here:
